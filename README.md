Face Detection + Auto Labelling
====================

Face Detection on school year group photo and automatic labelling.

![Demo](https://github.com/catree/QFaceDetectionAndLabelling/blob/master/Demo.gif)


## Development environment
- Windows 7 64 bits
- Visual Studio 2010
- OpenCV 2.4.10
- Qt 5.5.0
- binarie compiled in 32 bits release mode


## Known issues
- The deletion of a label by a left double click seems to be sometimes buggy and require to try many times 


## TODO
- [ ] Add a setting dialog to allow the modification of some parameters (Cascade classifier learning file, size of the label box, etc.)
- [ ] Try to find a way to use more classical fonts than those provided by OpenCV
